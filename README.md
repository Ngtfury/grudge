# [Project Name] üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: [Sreeramachandran S Menon's Team]


### Project Description
GrudgeGPT is an AI-powered app that lets you log personal grudges and emotionally score people based on their past behavior. When someone asks for a favor, the app roasts you for even considering it. It's petty, sarcastic, and completely unnecessary ‚Äî in the best way.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
We often forget how people have treated us ‚Äî good or bad ‚Äî and end up repeating the same emotional mistakes. There's no easy way to track small betrayals or patterns of behavior over time. Sometimes, a little memory (and petty honesty) goes a long way.


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
GrudgeGPT lets you log every petty betrayal, score it emotionally, and get roasted by AI if you even think about forgiving or helping the culprit. It‚Äôs your emotionally unavailable best friend with receipts ‚Äî because closure is overrated, and revenge has a UI.
