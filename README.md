# [GrudgeGPT: A Grudge Reminder] 🎯


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Sreeramachandran S Menon's Team


### Project Description
GrudgeGPT is an AI-powered app that lets you log personal grudges and emotionally score people based on their past behavior. When someone asks for a favor, the app roasts you for even considering it. It's petty, sarcastic, and completely unnecessary — in the best way.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
We often forget how people have treated us — good or bad — and end up repeating the same emotional mistakes. There's no easy way to track small betrayals or patterns of behavior over time. Sometimes, a little memory (and petty honesty) goes a long way.


### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
GrudgeGPT lets you log every petty betrayal, score it emotionally, and get roasted by AI if you even think about forgiving or helping the culprit. It’s your emotionally unavailable best friend with receipts — because closure is overrated, and revenge has a UI.

GrudgeGPT is your AI-powered emotional memory. Log every petty betrayal, from ignored texts to stolen snacks, and let the app score, store, and roast accordingly. Whether you're tracking who owes you or deciding if they deserve a favor, GrudgeGPT never forgets — even when you want to.

The "Add Grudge" feature lets you log a new offense someone committed, like “He canceled plans last minute.” You input the grudge, tag the person, and the app analyzes it, assigning emotional scores like betrayal and annoyance. It then saves the grudge, updates the person’s score, and prepares a dramatic, sarcastic reply for future reference.

The Leaderboard ranks people based on how badly they’ve treated you, using the emotional scores from your logged grudges. The higher the score, the worse their behavior — turning your emotional baggage into a public scoreboard of betrayal. It’s petty, personal, and painfully satisfying.
